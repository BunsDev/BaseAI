Accomplished engineering leader; [who loves the purple color](https://ahmadawais.com/shades-of-purple/).  
_purple is genius!_

I like computers, problems, and using the former to solve the latter. I believe in elegance over adequacy, thoughtfulness over impulse, and the wonder of the world as we see it. I have been developing and designing web pages since the early days of tables and spacers. And no – I’ve never used the scrolling marquee with Comic Sans fonts. ![Image 2: 😅](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f605.svg)
