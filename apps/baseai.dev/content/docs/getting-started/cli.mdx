# BaseAI CLI

The BaseAI CLI allows you to develop, build, and deploy BaseAI primitives from the command line to Langbase. This document provides an overview of the commands available in the CLI.

---

## Basic Usage

```bash
npx baseai [command]
```

---

## Commands

The following commands are available in the CLI:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Initializes the setup of BaseAI |
| `dev` | Starts the local server of BaseAI in development mode |
| `pipe` | Starts the process of creating a pipe in your application |
| `memory` | Starts the process of creating a memory in your application |
| `tool` | Starts the process of creating a tool in your application |
| `add` | Adds a pipe present on Langbase to your project |
| `auth` | Starts the authentication process of BaseAI with Langbase |
| `build` | Builds `pipes`, `memory` and `tools` for deployment to Langbase |
| `deploy` | Deploys your BaseAI application to Langbase |

---

### `init` command

`baseai init` initializes the setup of BaseAI at the root of your application. It installs `baseai` in your application, creates a `baseai` folder at the root, and adds a `baseai.config.json` file to this folder.

```bash
npx baseai init
```

---

### `dev` command

`baseai dev` starts the local server of BaseAI in development mode. This command is used for testing `pipes`, `memory` and `tools` of your application locally before deploying them to Langbase.

```bash
npx baseai dev
```

---

### `pipe` command

`baseai pipe` starts the process of creating a pipe in your application. Once a pipe is created, it will be available in the `pipes` folder of `baseai`.

```bash
npx baseai pipe
```

---

### `memory` command

`baseai memory` starts the process of creating a memory in your application. Once a memory is created, it will be available in the `memory` folder of `baseai`.

```bash
npx baseai memory
```

---

### `tool` command

`baseai tool` starts the process of creating a tool in your application. Once a tool is created, it will be available in the `tools` folder of `baseai`.

```bash
npx baseai tool
```

---

### `add` command

`baseai add` adds a pipe present on Langbase to your project. Once done, the pipe and its tools will become available in the `pipes` and `tools` folder of `baseai` respectively.

```bash
npx baseai add [owner-login/pipe-name]
```

OR

```bash
npx baseai add [link-to-pipe]
```

---

### `auth` command

`baseai auth` starts the authentication process of BaseAI with Langbase. Once done, you will be able to deploy `pipes`, `memory` and `tools` of your application to Langbase.

```bash
npx baseai auth
```

---

### `build` command

`baseai build` builds `pipes`, `memory` and `tools` of your application with BaseAI. These build files are then used during the deployment to Langbase.

```bash
npx baseai build
```

---

### `deploy` command

`baseai deploy` deploys `pipes`, `memory` and `tools` of your application to Langbase.

```bash
npx baseai deploy
```
