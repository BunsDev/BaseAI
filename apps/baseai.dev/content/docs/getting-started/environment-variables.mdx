# Environment Variables

---

## Overview

BaseAI uses `dotenv` package to manage environment variables. You can create `.env` file in the root of your project and add the required environment variables.

<Warn>
Please make sure to add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file of your project. This is to avoid committing your API keys to the git repository accidentally.
</Warn>

### Environment Variables

If the pipes present in your project use LLM models from any of the following providers, you will need to add their respective API keys to the `.env` file of your project.

```shell
# LOCAL ONLY.
OPENAI_API_KEY=""     # OpenAI
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""  # Anthropic
COHERE_API_KEY=""     # Cohere
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=""  # Fireworks
GOOGLE_API_KEY=""     # Google
GROQ_API_KEY=""       # Groq
MISTRAL_API_KEY=""    # Mistral
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="" # Perplexity
TOGETHER_API_KEY=""   # Together
```

Once you have added the environment variables, you will be able to run your AI `pipes` locally.

<Note>
The environment variables are only required for running the `pipes` locally. You do not need to add them when deploying your `pipes` to Langbase.
</Note>

### Memory

BaseAI uses OpenAI to generate embeddings of the documents present in the memory on your local. For this reason, you will need to add an OpenAI API key to the `.env` file of your project.

```shell
# LOCAL ONLY.
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # OpenAI
```
