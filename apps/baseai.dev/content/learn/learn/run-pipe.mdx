# Run summarizer Pipe in Node.js

### Learn how to run a summarizer pipe in Node.js using BaseAI

---

In this learn guide, you will locally run the summarizer pipe from the previous guide.

---

## Run Pipe with `tsx`

Run the `index.ts` file using the following command:

```bash
npx tsx index.ts
```

It will prompt the LLM model to summarize the content.

```txt
Langbase Studio is an AI development platform for building, collaborating, and deploying AI pipes. Key features include:

- Real-time experimentation with data.
- Message storage and prompt versioning.
- Collaboration among all team members and stakeholders (R&D, engineering, product, marketing).
```

This all happens locally on your machine and the response should be streamed in your terminal.

_In the next learn guide, we will create a local weather tool for our Pipe._
